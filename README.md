# 🐔 CIFAR-10 Image Classification Web App (Flask + CNN)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a deep learning-based image classification system built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and deployed with a Flask web application. The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 10 different classes: Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, and Truck.

The application allows users to upload an image through a web interface, processes the image using the trained model, and returns the predicted class along with a confidence score.

## Challenges Faced During Development

### GitHub Repository Management

- Faced difficulties pushing the project to GitHub after the data ingestion stage because of the large dataset size.
  
- Multiple attempts to push the repository were unsuccessful due to Git limitations and repository size.
- To resolve the issue, the Git repository was cleaned, reinitialized, and configured with an appropriate .gitignore file before pushing the project again.
  
- As a result of reinitializing the Git repositor y, the previous commit history was lost, reducing the total number of Git commits.

### Hardware Limitations

- The development machine did not have a dedicated GPU for deep learning model training.
- Therefore, the model was trained entirely on the CPU, which significantly increased the training time.
- Despite the hardware limitation, the complete end-to-end pipeline was successfully implemented and tested successfully.

### Debugging and Pipeline Integration

- Encountered several configuration and implementation issues while developing the modular end-to-end pipeline.
- Debugged problems related to project structure, configuration files, training pipeline, dependency management, and module integration.
- Successfully resolved the issues to ensure a stable, reproducible, and fully functional end-to-end workflow.
